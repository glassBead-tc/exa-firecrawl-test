Simple form validation with React Hook Form.

## Installation

Installing React Hook Form only takes a single command and you're ready to roll.

```
npm install react-hook-form
```

## Example

The following code excerpt demonstrates a basic usage example:

```
import{ useForm,SubmitHandler}from\"react-hook-form\"typeInputs={ example:string exampleRequired:string}exportdefaultfunctionApp(){const{ register, handleSubmit, watch, formState:{ errors },}=useForm ()const onSubmit:SubmitHandler =(data)=>console.log(data)console.log(watch(\"example\"))return( {} {} {}{errors.exampleRequired&& This field is required})}
```

## React Web Video Tutorial

This video tutorial illustrates the basic usage and concepts of React Hook Form.

## Register fields

One of the key concepts in React Hook Form is to **`register`** your component into the hook. This will make its value available for both the form validation and submission.

**Note:** Each field is **required** to have a `name` as a key for the registration process.

```
importReactDOMfrom\"react-dom\"import{ useForm,SubmitHandler}from\"react-hook-form\"enumGenderEnum{ female =\"female\", male =\"male\", other =\"other\",}interfaceIFormInput{ firstName:string gender:GenderEnum}exportdefaultfunctionApp(){const{ register, handleSubmit }=useForm ()const onSubmit:SubmitHandler =(data)=>console.log(data)return( First Name Gender Selection female male other)}
```

## Apply validation

React Hook Form makes form validation easy by aligning with the existing [HTML standard for form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation).

List of validation rules supported:

- required
- min
- max
- minLength
- maxLength
- pattern
- validate

You can read more detail on each rule in the [register section](https://react-hook-form.com/docs#register).

```
import{ useForm,SubmitHandler}from\"react-hook-form\"interfaceIFormInput{ firstName:string lastName:string age:number}exportdefaultfunctionApp(){const{ register, handleSubmit }=useForm ()const onSubmit:SubmitHandler =(data)=>console.log(data)return()}
```

## Integrating an existing form

Integrating an existing form should be simple. The important step is to `register` the component's `ref` and assign relevant props to your input.

```
import{Path, useForm,UseFormRegister,SubmitHandler}from\"react-hook-form\"interfaceIFormValues{\"First Name\":stringAge:number}typeInputProps={ label:Path register:UseFormRegister required:boolean}constInput=({ label, register, required }:InputProps)=>(<> {label})constSelect=React.forwardRef >>(({ onChange, onBlur, name, label }, ref)=>(<> {label} 20 30))constApp=()=>{const{ register, handleSubmit }=useForm ()const onSubmit:SubmitHandler =(data)=>{alert(JSON.stringify(data))}return()}
```

## Integrating with UI libraries

React Hook Form has made it easy to integrate with external UI component libraries. If the component doesn't expose input's `ref`, then you should use the [Controller](https://react-hook-form.com/docs#C
