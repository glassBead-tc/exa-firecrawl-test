Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js

## What is Axios?

Axios is a _[promise-based](https://javascript.info/promise-basics)_ HTTP Client for [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org) and the browser. It is _[isomorphic](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/what-is-an-isomorphic-application)_ (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js `http` module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.

## Features

- Make [XMLHttpRequests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) from the browser
- Make [http](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html) requests from node.js
- Supports the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) API
- Intercept request and response
- Transform request and response data
- Cancel requests
- Timeouts
- Query parameters serialization with support for nested entries
- Automatic request body serialization to:
 - JSON ( `application/json`)
 - Multipart / FormData ( `multipart/form-data`)
 - URL encoded form ( `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`)
- Posting HTML forms as JSON
- Automatic JSON data handling in response
- Progress capturing for browsers and node.js with extra info (speed rate, remaining time)
- Setting bandwidth limits for node.js
- Compatible with spec-compliant FormData and Blob (including `node.js`)
- Client side support for protecting against [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)
