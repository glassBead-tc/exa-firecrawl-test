## Installation [\#](http://3x.ant.design/3x.ant.design#Installation)

### Using npm or yarn [\#](http://3x.ant.design/3x.ant.design#Using-npm-or-yarn)

**We recommend using npm or yarn to install**, it not only makes development easier, but also allow you to take advantage of the rich ecosystem of Javascript packages and tooling.

```
$ npm install antd
```

```
$ yarn add antd
```

If you are in a bad network environment, you can try other registries and tools like [cnpm](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm).

### Import in Browser [\#](http://3x.ant.design/3x.ant.design#Import-in-Browser)

Add `script` and `link` tags in your browser and use the global variable `antd`.

We provide `antd.js` `antd.css` and `antd.min.js` `antd.min.css` under `antd/dist` in antd's npm package. You can also download these files directly from , or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/antd/dist).

> **We strongly discourage loading the entire files** this will add bloat to your application and make it more difficult to receive bugfixes and updates. Antd is intended to be used in conjunction with a build tool, such as [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), which will make it easy to import only the parts of antd that you are using.
>
> Note: you should import moment before using antd.j
