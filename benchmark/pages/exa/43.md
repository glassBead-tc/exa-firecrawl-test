[**Column Filtering Guide**](http://tanstack.com/tanstack.com#column-filtering-guide)

Filtering comes in 2 flavors: Column Filtering and Global Filtering.

This guide will focus on column filtering, which is a filter that is applied to a single column's accessor value.

TanStack table supports both both client-side and manual server-side filtering. This guide will go over how to implement and customize both, and help you decide which one is best for your use-case.

[**Client-Side vs Server-Side Filtering**](http://tanstack.com/tanstack.com#client-side-vs-server-side-filtering)

If you have a large dataset, you may not want to load all of that data into the client's browser in order to filter it. In this case, you will most likely want to implement server-side filtering, sorting, pagination, etc.

However, as also discussed in the [Pagination Guide](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/guide/pagination#should-you-use-client-side-pagination), a lot of developers underestimate how many rows can be loaded client-side without a performance hit. The TanStack table examples are often tested to handle up to 100,000 rows or more with decent performance for client-side filtering, sorting, pagination, and grouping. This doesn't necessarily that your app will be able to handle that many rows, but if your table is only going to have a few thousand rows at most, you might be able to take advantage of the client-side filtering, sorting, pagination, and grouping that TanStack table provides.

> TanStack Table can handle thousands of client-side rows with good performance. Don't rule out client-side filtering, pagination, sorting, etc. without some thought first.

Every use-case is different and will depend on the complexity of the table, how many columns you have, how large every piece of data is, etc. The main bottlenecks to pay attention to are:

1. Can your server query all of the data in a reasonable amount of time (and cost)?
2. What is the total size of the fetch? (This might not scale as badly as you think if you don't have many columns.)
3. Is the client's browser using too much memory if all of the data is loaded at once?

If you're not sure, you can always start with cli
