## TanStackQuery

## Powerful asynchronous state management for TS/JS, React, Solid, Vue, Svelte and Angular

Toss out that granular state management, manual refetching and endless bowls of async-spaghetti code. TanStack Query gives you declarative, always-up-to-date auto-managed queries and mutations that **directly improve both your developer and user experiences**.

### Declarative & Automatic

Writing your data fetching logic by hand is over. Tell TanStack Query where to get your data and how fresh you need it to be and the rest is automatic. It handles caching, background updates and stale data out of the box with zero-configuration.

### Simple & Familiar

If you know how to work with promises or async/await, then you already know how to use TanStack Query. There's no global state to manage, reducers, normalization systems or heavy configurations to understand. Simply pass a function that resolves your data (or throws an error) and the rest is history.

### Extensible

TanStack Query is configurable down to each observer instance of a query with knobs and options to fit every use-case. It comes wired up with dedicated devtools, infinite-loading APIs, and first class mutation tools that make updating your data a breeze. Don't worry though, everything is pre-configured for success!

### No dependencies. All the Features.

With zero dependencies, TanStack Query is extremely lean given the dense feature set it provides. From weekend hobbies all the way to enterprise e-commerce systems (Yes, I'm lookin' at you Walmart! ðŸ˜‰), TanStack Query is the battle-hardened tool to help you succeed at the speed of your creativity.

### Less code, fewer edge cases.

Instead of writing reducers, caching logic, timers, retry logic, complex async/await scripting (I could keep going...), you literally write a tiny fraction of the code you normally would. You will be surprised at how little code you're writing or how much code you're deleting when you use TanStack Query. Try it out with one of the examples below!

Wow, you've come a long way!
