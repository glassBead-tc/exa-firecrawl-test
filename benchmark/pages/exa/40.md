[**Table Instance Guide**](http://tanstack.com/tanstack.com#table-instance-guide)

TanStack Table is a headless UI library. When we talk about the table or "table instance", we're not talking about a literal element. Instead, we're referring to the core table object that contains the table state and APIs. The table instance is created by calling your adapter's createTable function (e.g. useReactTable, createSolidTable, createSvelteTable, useQwikTable, useVueTable).

[**Creating a Table Instance**](http://tanstack.com/tanstack.com#creating-a-table-instance)

To create a table instance, 2 options are required: columns and data. There are dozens of other table options to configure features and behavior, but these 2 are required.

[**Defining Data**](http://tanstack.com/tanstack.com#defining-data)

data is an array of objects that will be turned into the rows of your table. Each object in the array represents a row of data (under normal circumstances). If you are using TypeScript, we usually define a type for the shape of our data. This type is used as a generic type for all of the other table, column, row, and cell instances. This type is usually referred to as TData.

For example, if we have a table that displays a list of users in an array like this:

```
[
 {
 "firstName": "Tanner",
 "lastName": "Linsley",
 "age": 33,
 "visits": 100,
 "progress": 50,
 "status": "Married"
 },
 {
 "firstName": "Kevin",
 "lastName": "Vandy",
 "age": 27,
 "visits": 200,
 "progress": 100,
 "status": "Single"
 }
]

```

```
[
 {
 "firstName": "Tanner",
 "lastName": "Linsley",
 "age": 33,
 "visits": 100,
 "progress": 50,
 "status": "Married"
 },
 {
 "firstName": "Kevin",
 "lastName": "Vandy",
 "age": 27,
 "visits": 200,
 "progress": 100,
 "status": "Single"
 }
]

```

Then we can define a User (TData) type like this:

```
//TData
type User = {
 firstName: string
 lastName: string
 age: number
 visits: number
 status: string
 progress: number
}

```

```
//TData
type User = {
 firstName: string
 lastName: string
 age: number
 visits: number
 progress: string
 status: string
}

```

We can then define our data array with this type, and then TanStack Table will be able to intelligently infer lots of types for us later on in our columns, rows, cells, etc.

```
//note: data needs a "stable" reference in order to prevent infinite re-renders
const data: User[] = []
//or
const [data, setData] = React.useState ([])
//or
const data = ref ([])
//etc...

```

```
//note: data needs a "stable" reference in order to prevent infinite re-renders
const data: User[] = []
//or
const [data, setData] = React.useState ([])
//or
const data = ref ([])
//etc...

```

> Note: data needs a "stable" reference (especially in React) in order to prevent infinite re-renders. This is why we recommend using React.useState or React.useMemo, or defining your data outside of the same react c
