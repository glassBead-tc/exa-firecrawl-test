## [\#](http://www.solidjs.com/www.solidjs.com\#basic-reactivity) Basic Reactivity

Solid's overall approach to reactivity is to wrap any reactive computation in
a function, and rerun that function when its dependencies update.
The Solid JSX compiler also wraps most JSX expressions (code in braces) with a
function, so they automatically update (and trigger corresponding DOM updates)
when their dependencies change.
More precisely, automatic rerunning of a function happens whenever the function
gets called in a _tracking scope_, such as a JSX expression
or API calls that build "computations" ( `createEffect`, `createMemo`, etc.).
By default, the dependencies of a function get tracked automatically
when they're called in a tracking scope, by detecting when the function reads
reactive state (e.g., via a Signal getter or Store attribute).
As a result, you generally don't need to worry about dependencies yourselves.
(But if automatic dependency tracking ever doesn't produce the results you
want, you can [override dependency tracking](http://www.solidjs.com/www.solidjs.com#reactive-utilities).)
This approach makes reactivity _composable_: calling one function
within another function generally causes the calling function
to inherit the dependencies of the called function.

## [\#](http://www.solidjs.com/www.solidjs.com\#createsignal) `createSignal`

```
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";
function createSignal (
 initialValue: T,
 options?: { equals?: false | ((prev: T, next: T) => boolean) }
): [get: () => T, set: (v: T) => T];
// available types for return value of createSignal:
import type { Signal, Accessor, Setter } from "solid-js";
type Signal = [get: Accessor, set: Setter];
type Accessor = () => T;
type Setter = (v: T | ((prev?: T) => T)) => T;

```

Signals are the most basic reactive primitive. They track a single value
(which can be any JavaScript object) that changes over time.
The Signal's value starts out equal to the passed first argument
`initialValue` (or `undefined` if there are no arguments).
The `createSignal` function returns a pair of functions as a two-element array:
a _getter_ (or _accessor_) and a _setter_. In typical use, you would
destructure this array into a named Signal like so:

```
const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
const [ready, setReady] = createSignal(false);

```

Calling the getter (e.g., `count()` or `ready()`)
returns the current value of the Signal.
Crucial to automatic dependency tracking, calling the getter
within a tracking scope causes the calling function to depend on this Signal,
so that function will rerun if the Signal gets updated.

Calling the setter (e.g., `setCount(nextCount)` or `setReady(nextReady)`)
sets the Signal's value and _updates_ the Signal
(triggering dependents to rerun)
if the value actually changed (see details below).
As its only argument, the setter takes either the new value for the signal,
or a function that maps the last value of the signal to a new value.
The setter also
