# Ant Design of React

Following the Ant Design specification, we developed a React UI library `antd` (Pronunciation) that contains a set of high quality components and demos for building rich, interactive user interfaces.

Polyfills are needed for IE browsers. We recommend [@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env) for it. You can set `targets` config if you are using [umi](https://umijs.org/).

> Dropped support of IE8 after `antd@2.0`. Dropped support of React 15 and IE9/10 after `antd@4.0`. Dropped support of IE after `antd@5.0`.

## Version

- Stable: [![npm package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/antd.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/antd)

## Installation

### Using npm or yarn or pnpm or bun

**We recommend using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/) to install**, it not only makes development easier, but also allow you to take advantage of the rich ecosystem of Javascript packages and tooling.

npm iconnpm

yarn iconyarn

pnpm iconpnpm

Bun LogoBun

bash

```

$ npm install antd --save
```

If you are in a bad network environment, you can try other registries and tools like [cnpm](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm).

### Import in Browser

Add `script` and `link` tags in your browser and use the global variable `antd`.

We provide `antd.js` and `antd.min.js` `reset.css` under [dist](https://unpkg.com/browse/antd@5.0.0/dist/) folder in antd's npm package. You can also download these files directly from [![CDNJS](https://img.shields.io/cdnjs/v/antd.svg?style=flat-square)](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/antd), [![](https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/antd/badge)](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/antd) or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/antd/dist).

> **We strongly discourage loading the entire files** this will add bloat to your application and make it more difficult to receive bugfixes and updates. Antd is intended to be used in conjunction with a build tool, such as [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), which will make it easy to import only the parts of antd that you are using.

> Note: You should import `react`, `react-dom`, `dayjs` before using `antd.js`.

<h2><a name="usage"></a> Usage</h2>

jsx

```

import React from 'react';

import { DatePicker } from 'antd';

const App = () => {

  return <DatePicker />;

};

export default App;
```

<h3>Use modularized antd</h3>

`antd` supports ES modules tree shaking by default.

<h3>TypeScript</h3>

`antd` provides a built-in ts definition, don't install `@types/antd`.
