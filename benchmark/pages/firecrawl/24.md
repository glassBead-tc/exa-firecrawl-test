# `useHover` and `useHoverDirty`

[Permalink: useHover and useHoverDirty](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useHover.md#usehover-and-usehoverdirty)

React UI sensor hooks that track if some element is being hovered
by a mouse.

- `useHover` accepts a React element or a function that returns one,
`useHoverDirty` accepts React ref.
- `useHover` sets react `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` events,
`useHoverDirty` sets DOM `onmouseover` and `onmouseout` events.

## Usage

[Permalink: Usage](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useHover.md#usage)

```
import {useHover} from 'react-use';

const Demo = () => {
  const element = (hovered) =>
    <div>
      Hover me! {hovered && 'Thanks!'}
    </div>;
  const [hoverable, hovered] = useHover(element);

  return (
    <div>
      {hoverable}
      <div>{hovered ? 'HOVERED' : ''}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Reference

[Permalink: Reference](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useHover.md#reference)

const [newReactElement, isHovering] = useHover((isHovering) => reactElement);
