# Overview

Let's face it, forms are really verbose in
[React](https://github.com/facebook/react). To make matters worse, most form
helpers do wayyyy too much magic and often have a significant performance cost
associated with them. Formik is a small library that helps you with the 3 most
annoying parts:

1. Getting values in and out of form state
2. Validation and error messages
3. Handling form submission

By colocating all of the above in one place, Formik will keep things
organized--making testing, refactoring, and reasoning about your forms a breeze.

## Motivation [Direct link to heading](https://formik.org/docs/overview\#motivation "Direct link to heading")

I ( [@jaredpalmer](https://twitter.com/jaredpalmer)) wrote Formik while building a large internal administrative dashboard with
[@eonwhite](https://twitter.com/eonwhite). With around ~30 unique forms, it
quickly became obvious that we could benefit by standardizing not just our input
components but also the way in which data flowed through our forms.

### Why not Redux-Form? [Direct link to heading](https://formik.org/docs/overview\#why-not-redux-form "Direct link to heading")

By now, you might be thinking, "Why didn't you just use
[Redux-Form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form)?" Good question.

1. According to our prophet Dan Abramov,
[**form state is inherently ephemeral and local**, so tracking it in Redux (or any kind of Flux library) is unnecessary](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1287#issuecomment-175351978)
2. Redux-Form calls your entire top-level Redux reducer multiple times ON EVERY
SINGLE KEYSTROKE. This is fine for small apps, but as your Redux app grows,
input latency will continue to increase if you use Redux-Form.
3. Redux-Form is 22.5 kB minified gzipped (Formik is 12.7 kB)

**My goal with Formik was to create a scalable, performant, form helper with a**
**minimal API that does the really really annoying stuff, and leaves the rest up**
**to you.**

My talk at React Alicante goes much deeper into Formik's motivation and philosophy, introduces the library (by watching me build a mini version of it), and demos how to build a non-trivial form (with arrays, custom inputs, etc.) using the real thing.

## Influences [Direct link to heading](https://formik.org/docs/overview\#influences "Direct link to heading")

Formik started by expanding on
[this little higher order component](https://github.com/jxnblk/rebass-recomposed/blob/master/src/withForm.js)
by [Brent Jackson](https://github.com/jxnblk), some naming conventions from
Redux-Form, and (most recently) the render props approach popularized by
[React-Motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion) and
[React-Router 4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router). Whether you
have used any of the above or not, Formik only takes a few minutes to get
started with.

## Installation [Direct link to heading](https://formik.org/docs/overview\#installation "Direct link to heading")

You can install Formik with [NPM](https://npmjs.com/),
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), or a good ol' `<script>` via
[unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/).

### NPM [Direct link to heading](https://formik.org/docs/overview\#npm "Direct link to heading")

Copy

```

 npm install formik --save
```

or

Copy

```

 yarn add formik
```

Formik is compatible with React v15+ and works with ReactDOM and React Native.

You can also try before you buy with this
**[demo of Formik on CodeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/zKrK5YLDZ)**

### In-browser Playgrounds [Direct link to heading](https://formik.org/docs/overview\#in-browser-playgrounds "Direct link to heading")

You can play with Formik in your web browser with these live online playgrounds.

- [CodeSandbox (ReactDOM)](https://codesandbox.io/s/zKrK5YLDZ)
- [Snack (React Native)](https://snack.expo.io/?dependencies=yup%2Cformik%2Creact-native-paper%2Cexpo-constants&sourceUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2Fbrentvatne%2F700e1dbf9c3e88a11aef8e557627ce3f%2Fraw%2Feeee57721c9890c1212ac34a4c37707f6354f469%2FApp.js)

## The Gist [Direct link to heading](https://formik.org/docs/overview\#the-gist "Direct link to heading")

Formik keeps track of your form's state and then exposes it plus a few reusable
methods and event handlers ( `handleChange`, `handleBlur`, and `handleSubmit`) to
your form via `props`. `handleChange` and `handleBlur` work exactly as
expected--they use a `name` or `id` attribute to figure out which field to
update.

Copy

```

1 import React from 'react';
2 import { Formik } from 'formik';
3

4 const Basic = () => (
5   <div>
6     <h1>Anywhere in your app!</h1>
7     <Formik
8       initialValues={{ email: '', password: '' }}
9       validate={values => {
10         const errors = {};
11         if (!values.email) {
12           errors.email = 'Required';
13         } else if (
14           !/^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}$/i.test(values.email)
15         ) {
16           errors.email = 'Invalid email address';
17         }
18         return errors;
19       }}
20       onSubmit={(values, { setSubmitting }) => {
21         setTimeout(() => {
22           alert(JSON.stringify(values, null, 2));
23           setSubmitting(false);
24         }, 400);
25       }}
26     >
27       {({
28         values,
29         errors,
30         touched,
31         handleChange,
32         handleBlur,
33         handleSubmit,
34         isSubmitting,
35         /* and other goodies */
36       }) => (
37         <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
38           <input
39             type="email"
40             name="email"
41             onChange={handleChange}
42             onBlur={handleBlur}
43             value={values.email}
44           />
45           {errors.email && touched.email && errors.email}
46           <input
47             type="password"
48             name="password"
49             onChange={handleChange}
50             onBlur={handleBlur}
51             value={values.password}
52           />
53           {errors.password && touched.password && errors.password}
54           <button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>
55             Submit
56           </button>
57         </form>
58       )}
59     </Formik>
60   </div>
61 );
62

63 export default Basic;
```

### Reducing boilerplate [Direct link to heading](https://formik.org/docs/overview\#reducing-boilerplate "Direct link to heading")

The code above is very explicit about exactly what Formik is doing. `onChange` -\> `handleChange`, `onBlur` -\> `handleBlur`, and so on. However, to save you time, Formik comes with a few extra components to make life easier and less verbose: `<Form />`, `<Field />`, and `<ErrorMessage />`. They use React context to hook into the parent `<Formik />` state/methods.

Copy

```

1 // Render Prop
2 import React from 'react';
3 import { Formik, Form, Field, ErrorMessage } from 'formik';
4

5 const Basic = () => (
6   <div>
7     <h1>Any place in your app!</h1>
8     <Formik
9       initialValues={{ email: '', password: '' }}
10       validate={values => {
11         const errors = {};
13         if (!values.email) {
14           errors.email = 'Required';
15         } else if (
16           !/^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}$/i.test(values.email)
17         ) {
18           errors.email = 'Invalid email address';
19         }
20         return errors;
21       }}
22       onSubmit={(values, { setSubmitting }) => {
23         setTimeout(() => {
24           alert(JSON.stringify(values, null, 2));
25           setSubmitting(false);
26         }, 400);
27       }}
28     >
29       {({ isSubmitting }) => (
30         <Form>
31           <Field type="email" name="email" />
32           <ErrorMessage name="email" component="div" />
33           <Field type="password" name="password" />
34           <ErrorMessage name="password" component="div" />
35           <button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>
36             Submit
37           </button>
38         </Form>
39       )}
40     </Formik>
41   </div>
42 );
43

44 export default Basic;
```

### Complementary Packages [Direct link to heading](https://formik.org/docs/overview\#complementary-packages "Direct link to heading")

As you can see above, validation is left up to you. Feel free to write your own
validators or use a 3rd party library. Personally, I use
[Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for object schema validation. It has an
API that's pretty similar to [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) /
[React PropTypes](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types) but is small enough
for the browser and fast enough for runtime usage. Because I ❤️ Yup sooo
much, Formik has a special config option / prop for Yup called
[`validationSchema`](https://formik.org/docs/api/formik#validationschema-schema----schema) which will
automatically transform Yup's validation errors into a pretty object whose keys
match [`values`](https://formik.org/docs/api/formik#values-field-string-any) and
[`touched`](https://formik.org/docs/api/formik#touched-field-string-boolean). Anyways, you can
install Yup from npm...

Copy

```

 npm install yup --save
```

or

Copy

```

 yarn add yup
```

You will be run twice—first with server = exa, then (after I edit the MCP config) with server = firecrawl.  Each run must process the exact same set of {id, url} pairs so that we can compare the two servers one-to-one.

Input artifact
A file called urls-list.md containing lines in this exact format (one per line):

{id: 1, url: "https://axios-http.com"}
{id: 2, url: "https://github.com/TanStack/table/releases/tag/v7.0.0"}
…
{id: 121, url: "https://aurelia.io/home"}

Single parameter
	•	server: either "exa" or "firecrawl" for the current pass.

Step-by-step instructions
	1.	Read every line of urls-list.md, parse out the integer {id} and the string {url}.  Preserve the order in the file.
	2.	For each {id, url} pair, in sequence:
	•	If server == "exa"
	1.	Call the Exa MCP endpoint with {url}.
	2.	Extract the "content" text field (no metadata).
	•	If server == "firecrawl-mcp"
	1.	Call the Firecrawl MCP endpoint with {url}.
	2.	The response is already Markdown.
	3.	Save the raw body exactly as received (no rewriting) to:

benchmark/pages/{server}/{id}.md

Prepend this three-line front-matter block to every file:

---
source_url: "{url}"
retrieved_at: "<2025-06-19T…Z>"
mcp_server: "{server}"
---


	4.	After writing each file, print exactly one JSON object (and nothing else) on stdout:

{
  "id": "{id}",
  "server": "{server}",
  "byteLength": <integer>,
  "savedAs": "benchmark/pages/{server}/{id}.md"
}


	5.	Continue until all lines in urls-list.md are processed, then exit.

Constraints & error handling
	•	Retry each HTTP request once on network error, then treat as empty.
	•	If status ≠ 200 or body < 500 bytes: still save a file (with only front-matter), set "byteLength": 0.
	•	Your only output must be the sequence of JSON lines (one per URL).

Outcome
Two directories—benchmark/pages/exa/ and benchmark/pages/firecrawl/—populated with matching {id}.md files, ready for LLM-as-Judge comparison.</role>

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Global Instructions:
if you encounter unexpected output, i'd like you to perform the following workflow for dealing with it:

1. call context7 via MCP for relevant documentation on the issue
2. if proper docs are found, implement a correction based on what you find there
3. if the correction doesn't work, call the sequential-thinking server to reason through why we got it wrong twice and to reason through it from another angle. feel free to use retrieval/search MCP servers like ask-perplexity and exa while you work through the sequential thinking process.
4. implement your revised correction
5. if the second correction doesn't work, ask me, the human user, to help you out.</custom_instructions>
