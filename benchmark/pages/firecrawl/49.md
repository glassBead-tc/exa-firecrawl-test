# Keyboard Manager utility

- 11/18/2024

Feedback

The PowerToys Keyboard Manager enables you to redefine keys on your keyboard.

For example, you can exchange the letter `A` for the letter `B` on your keyboard. When you press the `A` key, a `B` will be inserted.

![PowerToys Keyboard Manager remap keys screenshot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/images/powertoys-keyboard-remap.png)

You can exchange shortcut key combinations. For example: The shortcut key `Ctrl` + `C` will copy text in many applications. With PowerToys Keyboard Manager utility, you can swap that shortcut for `⊞ Win` + `C`. Now, `⊞ Win` + `C` will copy text. If you do not specify a targeted application in PowerToys Keyboard Manager, the shortcut exchange will be applied globally across Windows.

Also, you can exchange a key or shortcut to an arbitrary unicode text sequence. For example, you can exchange the letter `H` for the text `Hello!`. When you press the `H` key, `Hello!` will be inserted. Similarly, you can use the shortcut `Ctrl` + `G` to send some text (e.g. `Hello from shortcut!`).

PowerToys Keyboard Manager must be enabled (with PowerToys running in the background) for remapped keys and shortcuts to be applied. If PowerToys is not running, key remapping will no longer be applied.

Important

There are some shortcut keys that are reserved by the operating system or cannot be replaced. Keys that cannot be remapped include:

- `⊞ Win` + `L` and `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Del` cannot be remapped as they are reserved by the Windows OS.
- The `Fn` (function) key cannot be remapped (in most cases). The `F1` ~ `F12` (and `F13` ~ `F24`) keys can be mapped.
- `Pause` will only send a single key-down event. So mapping it against the backspace key, for instance, and pressing and holding will only delete a single character.
- `⊞ Win` + `G` often opens the Xbox Game Bar, even when reassigned. Game Bar can be disabled in [Windows Settings](ms-settings:gaming-gamebar).

[Section titled: Settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#settings)

## Settings

To create mappings with Keyboard Manager, open the PowerToys Settings. In PowerToys Settings, on the Keyboard Manager tab, you'll see options to:

- Open the Remap Keys settings window by selecting **Remap a key**
- Open the Remap Shortcuts settings window by selecting **Remap a shortcut**

[Section titled: Remapping keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#remapping-keys)

### Remapping keys

To remap a key, open the Remap Keyboard settings window with **Remap a Key**. When first opened, no predefined mappings will be displayed. Select **Add key remapping** to add a new remap. Note that various keyboard keys actually send a shortcut.

Once a new remap row appears, select the input key whose output you want to _change_ in the "Select" column. Select the new key, shortcut, or text value to assign in the "To send" column.

For example, to press `A` and have `B` appear:

Expand table

| Select: | To send: |
| --- | --- |
| `A` | `B` |

To swap key positions between the `A` and `B` keys, add another remapping with:

Expand table

| Select: | To send: |
| --- | --- |
| `B` | `A` |

![Keyboard Remap Keys screenshot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/images/powertoys-keyboard-remap-a-b.png)

[Section titled: Remapping a key to a shortcut](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#remapping-a-key-to-a-shortcut)

### Remapping a key to a shortcut

To remap a key to a shortcut (combination of keys), enter the shortcut key combination in the "To send" column.

For example, to press the `Ctrl` key and have it result in `⊞ Win` \+ `←` (left arrow):

Expand table

| Select: | To send: |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl` | `⊞ Win` \+ `←` |

Important

Key remapping will be maintained even if the remapped key is used inside another shortcut. The order of key press matters in this scenario as the action is executed during key-down, not key-up. For example, pressing `Ctrl` + `C` would result as `⊞ Win` \+ `left arrow` \+ `C`. Pressing the `Ctrl` key will first execute `⊞ Win` \+ `left arrow`. Pressing the `C` key first will execute `C` \+ `⊞ Win` \+ `left arrow`.

[Section titled: Remapping a key to text](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#remapping-a-key-to-text)

### Remapping a key to text

To remap a key to arbitrary unicode text, in the "To send" column first select "Text" in the combo box and then fill the text box with wanted text.

For example, to press the `H` key and have it result in `Hello!`:

Expand table

| Select: | To send: |
| --- | --- |
| `H` | `Hello!` |

[Section titled: Remapping shortcuts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#remapping-shortcuts)

### Remapping shortcuts

To remap a shortcut key combination, like `Ctrl` + `C`, select **Remap a shortcut** to open the Remap Shortcuts settings window.

When first opened, no predefined mappings will be displayed. Select **Add shortcut remapping** to add a new remap.

When a new remap row appears, select the input keys whose output you want to _change_ in the "Select" column. Select the new shortcut value to assign in the "To send" column.

For example, the shortcut `Ctrl` + `C` copies selected text. To remap that shortcut to use the `Alt` key, rather than the `Ctrl` key:

Expand table

| Select: | To send: |
| --- | --- |
| `Alt` \+ `C` | `Ctrl` \+ `C` |

![Keyboard Remap Shortcut screenshot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/images/powertoys-keyboard-remap-shortcut.png)

There are a few rules to follow when remapping shortcuts. These rules only apply to the "Shortcut" column.

- Shortcuts must begin with a modifier key: `Ctrl`, `Shift`, `Alt`, or `⊞ Win`
- Shortcuts must end with an action key (all non-modifier keys): A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, etc.
- Shortcuts can't exceed four keys in length, or five if the shortcut is a 'chord'.

[Section titled: Shortcuts with chords](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#shortcuts-with-chords)

#### Shortcuts with chords

Chords are handy if you have a number of shortcuts that are similar, and it makes sense to have them all start with the same non-modifier key.

[Section titled: Remap a shortcut to a single key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#remap-a-shortcut-to-a-single-key)

### Remap a shortcut to a single key

It's possible to remap a shortcut (key combination) to a single key press by selecting **Remap a shortcut** in PowerToys Settings.

For example, to replace the shortcut `⊞ Win` + `←` (left arrow) with a single key press **Alt**:

Expand table

| Select: | To send: |
| --- | --- |
| `⊞ Win` \+ `←` | `Alt` |

Important

Shortcut remapping will be maintained even if the remapped key is used inside another shortcut. The order of key press matters in this scenario as the action is executed during key-down, not key-up. For example: pressing `⊞ Win` + `←` + `Shift` would result in `Alt` \+ `Shift`.

The **Exact Match** option can be selected when creating a shortcut to single key mapping. Without specifying **Exact Match**, if the shortcut is pressed and other keys are also pressed, the single key mapping will still be sent.

For example, when replacing the shortcut `Ctrl` + `C` with an `A` key press, if **Exact Match** is enabled, the shortcut will only be replaced if no other keys are pressed.

[Section titled: Remap a shortcut to text](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#remap-a-shortcut-to-text)

### Remap a shortcut to text

For example, to replace the shortcut `Ctrl` + `G` with `Hello!` text, choose **Text** in the combo box and enter "Hello!":

Expand table

| Select: | To send: |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl` \+ `G` | `Hello!` |

[Section titled: Remap a shortcut to start an app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#remap-a-shortcut-to-start-an-app)

### Remap a shortcut to start an app

Keyboard Manager enables you to start applications with the activation of any shortcut. Choose **Start App** for the action in the "To:" column. There are a few options to configure when using this type of shortcut.

Expand table

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| App | This is the path to an executable. Environment variables will be expanded. |
| Args | Arguments that will be sent to the app. |
| Start in | The working directory for the app to start in. |
| Elevation | Specify the elevation level to start the app. The options include **Normal**, **Elevated**, and **Different User**. |
| If running | What action should be taken when this shortcut is activated while the app is already running? The options are: **Show Window**, **Start another instance**, **Do nothing**, **Close**, **End task**. |
| Visibility | The app will be visible. This is useful if the app is a console or something you don't want to see. |

[Section titled: Remap a shortcut to open a URI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#remap-a-shortcut-to-open-a-uri)

### Remap a shortcut to open a URI

This type of shortcut action will open a URI. The only input is the actual Path/URI. Almost anything you can issue on the command line should work. See [Launch an app with a URI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-resume/launch-app-with-uri) for more examples.

[Section titled: App-specific shortcuts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#app-specific-shortcuts)

### App-specific shortcuts

Keyboard Manager enables you to remap shortcuts for only specific apps (rather than globally across Windows).

For example, in the Outlook email app the shortcut `Ctrl` + `E` is set by default to search for an email. If you prefer instead to set `Ctrl` + `F` to search your email (rather than forward an email as set by default), you can remap the shortcut with "Outlook" set as your "Target app".

Keyboard Manager uses process names, not application names, to target apps. For example, Microsoft Edge is set as "msedge" (process name), not "Microsoft Edge" (application name). To find an application's process name, open PowerShell and enter the command `Get-Process` or open Command Prompt and enter the command `tasklist`. This will result in a list of process names for all applications you currently have open. Below is a list of a few popular application process names.

Expand table

| Application | Process name from `tasklist` |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft Edge | msedge.exe |
| OneNote | onenote.exe |
| Outlook | outlook.exe |
| Teams | ms-teams.exe |
| Adobe Photoshop | Photoshop.exe |
| File Explorer | explorer.exe |
| Spotify Music | spotify.exe |
| Google Chrome | chrome.exe |
| Excel | excel.exe |
| Word | winword.exe |
| Powerpoint | powerpnt.exe |

Note

If you use `tasklist` from the Command Prompt to get the list of processes, the process name will be listed in the **Image Name** column. The process names in `Get-Process` will not include the `.exe` file extensions. These process names do not match the process names in Windows **Task Manager** window.

[Section titled: How to select a key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#how-to-select-a-key)

## How to select a key

To select a key or shortcut to remap:

- Select **Select**.
- Use the drop-down menu.

Once you select **Select**, a dialog window will open in which you can enter the key or shortcut, using your keyboard. Once you’re satisfied with the output, hold `Enter` to continue. To leave the dialog, hold `Esc`.

Using the drop-down menu, you can search with the key name and additional drop-down values will appear as you progress. However, you can't use the type-key feature while the drop-down menu is open.

[Section titled: Orphaning Keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#orphaning-keys)

## Orphaning Keys

Orphaning a key means that you mapped it to another key and no longer have anything mapped to it. For example, if the key is remapped from `A` to `B`, then a key no longer exists on your keyboard that results in `A`. To remind you of this, a warning will display for any orphaned keys. To fix this, create another remapped key that is mapped to result in `A`.

![PowerToys Keyboard Manager orphaned key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/images/powertoys-keyboard-remap-orphaned.png)

[Section titled: Frequently asked questions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#frequently-asked-questions)

## Frequently asked questions

[Section titled: I remapped the wrong keys, how can I stop it quickly?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#i-remapped-the-wrong-keys-how-can-i-stop-it-quickly)

### I remapped the wrong keys, how can I stop it quickly?

For key remapping to work, PowerToys must be running in the background and Keyboard Manager must be enabled. To stop remapped keys, close PowerToys or disable Keyboard Manager in the PowerToys settings.

[Section titled: Can I use Keyboard Manager at my log-in screen?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#can-i-use-keyboard-manager-at-my-log-in-screen)

### Can I use Keyboard Manager at my log-in screen?

No, Keyboard Manager is only available when PowerToys is running and doesn't work on any password screen, including while Run As Admin.

[Section titled: Do I have to restart my computer or PowerToys for the remapping to take effect?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#do-i-have-to-restart-my-computer-or-powertoys-for-the-remapping-to-take-effect)

### Do I have to restart my computer or PowerToys for the remapping to take effect?

No, remapping should occur immediately upon pressing **OK**.

[Section titled: Where are the Mac/Linux profiles?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#where-are-the-maclinux-profiles)

### Where are the Mac/Linux profiles?

Currently Mac and Linux profiles aren't included.

[Section titled: Will this work on video games?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#will-this-work-on-video-games)

### Will this work on video games?

We suggest that you avoid using Keyboard Manager when playing games as it may affect the game's performance. It will also depend on how the game accesses your keys. Certain keyboard APIs do not work with Keyboard Manager.

[Section titled: Will remapping work if I change my input language?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#will-remapping-work-if-i-change-my-input-language)

### Will remapping work if I change my input language?

Yes it will. Right now, if you remap `A` to `B` on English (US) keyboard and then change the language setting to French, typing `A` on the French keyboard ( `Q` on the English US physical keyboard) would result in `B`, this is consistent with how Windows handles multilingual input.

[Section titled: Can I have different key mappings across multiple keyboards?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#can-i-have-different-key-mappings-across-multiple-keyboards)

### Can I have different key mappings across multiple keyboards?

Currently, no. We aren't aware of an API where we can see the input and which device it came from. The typical use case here is a laptop with an external keyboard connected.

[Section titled: I see keys listed in the drop down menus that don't work. Why is that?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#i-see-keys-listed-in-the-drop-down-menus-that-dont-work-why-is-that)

### I see keys listed in the drop down menus that don't work. Why is that?

Keyboard Manager lists mappings for all known physical keyboard keys. Some of these mappings may not be available on your keyboard as there may not be a physical key to which it corresponds. For instance, the `Start App 1` option shown below is only available on keyboards that physically have a `Start App 1` key. Trying to map to and from this key on a keyboard that does not support the `Start App 1` key will result in undefined behavior.

[Section titled: Troubleshooting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#troubleshooting)

## Troubleshooting

If you have tried to remap a key or shortcut and are having trouble, it could be one of the following issues:

- **Run As Admin:** Remapping won't work on an app or window if that window is running in administrator (elevated) mode and PowerToys is not running as administrator. Try [running PowerToys as an administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/administrator).
- **Not intercepting keys:** Keyboard Manager intercepts keyboard hooks to remap your keys. Some apps that also do this can interfere with Keyboard Manager. To fix this, go to the settings, disable and re-enable Keyboard Manager.

[Section titled: Known Issues](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager#known-issues)

## Known Issues

- Keyboard Manager shouldn't be used when playing video games. Keyboard Manager interception of key presses currently will impact the FPS.
- [Remapping keys like Win, Ctrl, Alt or Shift may break gestures and some special keys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/3703)
- AltGr and Ctrl+Alt gives issues, since AltGr behaves as (L)Ctrl + (R)Alt and remapping one of these keys can break the function.
- Note that some keyboard keys actually send a shortcut. Common examples are the Office key (Win+Ctrl+Alt+Shift) and the Copilot key (Win + C or Left-Shift + Windows key + F23).

See the list of all [open keyboard manager issues](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Product-Keyboard+Shortcut+Manager%22).

You will be run twice—first with server = exa, then (after I edit the MCP config) with server = firecrawl.  Each run must process the exact same set of {id, url} pairs so that we can compare the two servers one-to-one.

Input artifact
A file called urls-list.md containing lines in this exact format (one per line):

{id: 1, url: "https://axios-http.com"}
{id: 2, url: "https://github.com/TanStack/table/releases/tag/v7.0.0"}
…
{id: 121, url: "https://aurelia.io/home"}

Single parameter
	•	server: either "exa" or "firecrawl" for the current pass.

Step-by-step instructions
	1.	Read every line of urls-list.md, parse out the integer {id} and the string {url}.  Preserve the order in the file.
	2.	For each {id, url} pair, in sequence:
	•	If server == "exa"
	1.	Call the Exa MCP endpoint with {url}.
	2.	Extract the "content" text field (no metadata).
	•	If server == "firecrawl-mcp"
	1.	Call the Firecrawl MCP endpoint with {url}.
	2.	The response is already Markdown.
	3.	Save the raw body exactly as received (no rewriting) to:

benchmark/pages/{server}/{id}.md

Prepend this three-line front-matter block to every file:

---
source_url: "{url}"
retrieved_at: "<2025-06-19T…Z>"
mcp_server: "{server}"
---


	4.	After writing each file, print exactly one JSON object (and nothing else) on stdout:

{
  "id": "{id}",
  "server": "{server}",
  "byteLength": <integer>,
  "savedAs": "benchmark/pages/{server}/{id}.md"
}


	5.	Continue until all lines in urls-list.md are processed, then exit.

Constraints & error handling
	•	Retry each HTTP request once on network error, then treat as empty.
	•	If status ≠ 200 or body < 500 bytes: still save a file (with only front-matter), set "byteLength": 0.
	•	Your only output must be the sequence of JSON lines (one per URL).

Outcome
Two directories—benchmark/pages/exa/ and benchmark/pages/firecrawl/—populated with matching {id}.md files, ready for LLM-as-Judge comparison.</role>

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Global Instructions:
if you encounter unexpected output, i'd like you to perform the following workflow for dealing with it:

1. call context7 via MCP for relevant documentation on the issue
2. if proper docs are found, implement a correction based on what you find there
3. if the correction doesn't work, call the sequential-thinking server to reason through why we got it wrong twice and to reason through it from another angle. feel free to use retrieval/search MCP servers like ask-perplexity and exa while you work through the sequential thinking process.
4. implement your revised correction
5. if the second correction doesn't work, ask me, the human user, to help you out.</custom_instructions>
